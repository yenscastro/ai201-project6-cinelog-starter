## Your Task

You're working on the `feature/watchlist` branch, which adds a watchlist feature to CineLog. A maintainer (`@dev-lead`) has reviewed your PR and left six comments. Your job is to address all six.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before touching any code. Then check out the `feature/watchlist` branch:

```bash
git checkout feature/watchlist
```

The open PR and the maintainer's review comments are filed on GitHub. Work through each comment and document your responses in your **PR Response Doc**.
